Application is recommended to run on: Pixel 3a (API 29)

Note that upon running the application in Android Studio, there may be an error: 

"Your project has set `android.useAndroidX=true`, but configuration `debugRuntimeClasspath` still contains legacy support libraries, which may cause runtime issues.
  This behavior will not be allowed in Android Gradle plugin 8.0.
  Please use only AndroidX dependencies or set `android.enableJetifier=true` in the `gradle.properties` file to migrate your project to AndroidX (see https://developer.android.com/jetpack/androidx/migrate for more info).
  The following legacy support libraries are detected:"
  
This warning does not stop the application from running and so it is recommended to continue keep waiting for the application to start.
